Levetop LT7381 SPI display bridge bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "levetop,lt7381"
  - reg: Address of this bridge on the SPI bus.
  - rotate: Panel installed orientation.
  - width: Panel width [pixel counts] in accordance to its orientation.
  - height: Panel height [pixel counts] in accordance to its orientation.
  - reset-gpios: OF device-tree gpio specification for RST pin
                (active low system reset)
  - xtal-frequency: OF device-tree specification for XIN pins ref.
                    (Typical value is 10 Mhz)
  - pwm-count: = pwm period [clock cycles]
    d presents the duty cycle [percentage], which is also the current brightness
    level.

  - backlight-max-brightness: The maximum brightness [percentage].
    It is also the maximum duty cycle [d-max] from [Fig. 1].
  - backlight-default-brightness: The reset brightness on startup
  - display-timings: timings for the connected display according to [1]

The panel must obey rules for SPI slave device specified in document [2].

Optional properties:
  - bgr: when pixel format is bgr
  - test-patern: Enables the test pattern. The panel will only display the
                 generated test pattern, independent of the SDRAM.
