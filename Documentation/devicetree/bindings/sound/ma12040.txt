NOTE: Linux does not list the MA12040 amplifier as a device, because it have
      incomplete DAI properties, because it is not an actual codec, only an
      analogue playback device.
      It is therefor important to set this driver as a multi codec device in
      the device tree e.g sound-dai = <&dummy_codec &ma12040_20>; Linux will
      list the sound dai if one of the codecs have sufficient DAI parameters.

Required properties:

- compatible : "infineon,ma12040"
- reg : I2C slave address

Example:

ma12040_20: ma12040@20 {
	compatible = "infineon,ma12040";
	reg = <0x20>;
};
